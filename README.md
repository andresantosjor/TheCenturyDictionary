# The Century Dictionary

This is an authorized copy of "The Century Dictionary" held in the Peirce Edition Project, in IUPUI, Indianapolis, IN.

This repository holds a full copy of the dictionary, page by page, and handwritten commentary and revisions by C.S. Peirce, as one of the dictionary editors. 

The purpose of this repository is to make acessible this annotated copy, registering more than 260,000 entries, many defined by C.S. Peirce himself. The Century Dictionary, along with Baldwin's Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology, is one of the largest and most important repository of "clear definitions", per the pragramatic method, making it invaluable for the Peircean scholar and researcher.

For more information about The Century Dictionary, please consult [Century Dictionary Online](http://www.global-language.com/century/), another (non-annotaded) copy of the dictionary, in DjVu. The "About the Dictionary" section on their website has further historical information about the dictionary and its importance for scholars and the overal populace.

*How is this repository organized?* This repository imitates the original organization of the dictionary, in VIII volumes, here organized as eight folders. Every page is a searcheable PDF file. C.S. Peirce added interleaved sheets to his copy, writing on them instead of the dictionary's pages, so we added interleaved PDF files of each sheet, using the suffix `_ANN` for "annotation". Not every page has an interleaved annotation sheet.
